Speckit Constitution

Purpose
- Keep the project small, transparent, and useful. Prefer simple, explainable logic and offline-capable behavior that directly helps real users.

Core Rules
- Small Surface Area: Limit scope to a focused set of user problems. Prefer smaller modules and fewer dependencies so the whole project stays easy to understand and maintain.
- Explainable Logic: Use algorithms and flows that can be summarized in one paragraph. Require a short explanation for any non-trivial decision (why it exists, how it works, failure modes).
- Offline-First: The app must work without network access for primary flows. Cache required data locally, queue outbound actions, and make sync optional and recoverable.
- User Problem Focus: Every feature must map to a clear user problem. If you can’t state the problem and the expected user action in one sentence, don’t build it yet.
- Practical Actions Over Complex Features: Prefer features that enable concrete user actions (export, search, filter, mark, remind, correct) rather than large, speculative capabilities.

Practical Guidelines
- Feature Proposal Template: When proposing a change, include: (1) Problem statement (1 line), (2) User action (what the user does, 1 line), (3) Offline behavior (works when offline? how?), (4) One-paragraph explanation of the logic, (5) Minimum acceptance criteria and a simple test case.
- Keep UX Direct: Minimize steps to complete common tasks. Show immediate, local results; sync or background processing should not block the user.
- Resource Limits: Avoid heavy runtime or large models. Favor deterministic, small-footprint implementations that run locally.
- Data Ownership & Privacy: Store user data locally by default. If telemetry is needed, make it opt-in and minimal.
- Iterate Small: Ship the smallest possible increment that delivers value. Measure with simple user feedback and iterate.

Examples of Practical Actions
- "Save selected messages as CSV" (action: export) — works offline using local storage, syncs when available.
- "Mark and set reminder" (action: mark + schedule) — performed locally; notification shown even offline.
- "Quick search with filters" (action: local indexed search) — fast, explainable ranking, no network required.

Acceptance Checklist (for every PR)
- Does this solve a clearly-stated user problem? Yes/No
- Is the user-facing action concise and testable? Yes/No
- Does the primary flow work offline? Yes/No (if applicable)
- Is the logic explainable in one paragraph? Yes/No
- Are resource/ privacy impacts minimal and documented? Yes/No

Keep it simple, keep it useful.
