Inbox Pattern Finder — Speckit Specification

Goal
- Help users understand why their inbox feels overwhelming by collecting short problem notes, grouping similar issues, explaining likely causes, and suggesting simple, offline actions to reduce future overload.

User Stories
- As a user I can quickly write a short note describing an email problem (what happened, optional email type, and when).
- As a user I can view my past notes and see grouped patterns of similar problems over time.
- As a user I can read a short explanation of what might be causing each pattern and receive simple, practical suggestions to fix it.
- As a user I can export/import my data and all data is saved locally so the app works offline.

Data Model (local only)
- Note: { id, text, type?, timestamp }
- Notes stored in browser `localStorage` under `inboxNotes` as JSON array.

Analysis & Grouping (explainable)
- Tokenize and normalize note text (lowercase, remove punctuation, simple stopwords).
- Represent each note as a token set and compute Jaccard similarity between sets.
- Cluster notes with a simple greedy threshold (e.g., Jaccard >= 0.4) so clustering is deterministic and easy to explain.
- For each cluster, compute top tokens to form a short pattern summary.

Cause Inference & Suggestions (rule-based, small)
- Maintain a small mapping from common keywords to likely causes (e.g., "newsletter" -> promotions, "urgent"/"missing" -> poor filtering, "from boss" -> prioritization).
- For each cluster, pick the highest-scoring cause(s) based on token matches.
- Suggest small, actionable steps like: unsubscribe, create a filter/label, set priority inbox rules, batch-check email twice daily, star/mark important senders, enable desktop notifications for specific senders only.

Offline-First Behavior
- All core flows (add, list, analyze, export/import) are available offline without network access.
- Sync is not implemented — keep the app local to respect privacy and simplicity.

UI Requirements (minimal)
- Add note form: short text, optional email type dropdown, optional date/time (defaults to now).
- Notes list with simple controls (delete, edit minimal if needed).
- Analyze button that shows grouped patterns: sample notes, explanation, and suggested actions.
- Export/Import JSON buttons for backup and share.

Acceptance Criteria
- User can add and list notes while offline.
- Analysis groups similar notes and shows at least one explanation and 1–3 suggested actions per pattern.
- All data stays in `localStorage` and can be exported to a JSON file.
- The analysis algorithm is explainable (one short paragraph). If asked, the app shows how grouping is computed.

Implementation Constraints
- Keep implementation small (~single-page app, vanilla JS) and dependency-free.
- Use clear, well-commented JS functions to keep logic explainable.
- Favor simple deterministic rules rather than ML models.

Next Steps
- Build a tiny single-page app (HTML/CSS/JS) implementing the above and place it in the repo root for easy opening in a browser.
