Speckit Plan — Inbox Pattern Finder

Implementation Overview
- Platform: Single-page web app using plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
- Offline storage: Browser `localStorage` for all notes and settings; Export/Import JSON for backup.
- UI: Simple layout with an add-note form, notes list, and an Analyze view showing grouped patterns and suggestions.

Grouping & Analysis
- Approach: Lightweight keyword counting and simple token matching — deterministic and explainable.
- Tokenization: Lowercase, remove punctuation, filter common stopwords, produce token sets per note.
- Grouping: Count shared keywords across notes; cluster notes that share multiple top tokens (simple threshold).
- Summary: For each group, show top tokens and 1–2 sample notes.

Cause & Suggestions
- Rule-based mapping from common keywords to likely causes (e.g., newsletter → promotions, urgent/missed → prioritization problems).
- For each inferred cause, show 1–3 practical suggestions (unsubscribe, create filter, batch checking, highlight important senders).

UX & Behavior
- Minimal steps to add a note: text required, optional type, optional date/time (defaults to now).
- Analyze button runs the grouping algorithm locally and presents grouped patterns with short explanations.
- All primary flows work offline; no network requests or external dependencies.

Acceptance Criteria
- Add and list notes while offline.
- Clusters produced by simple keyword matching and shown with an explanation.
- Each cluster includes at least one practical suggestion.
- Data export/import via JSON works.

Implementation Steps
1. Create UI: `index.html` with form, notes list, analyze view. (Small, single file layout.)
2. Implement storage helpers: load/save from `localStorage`.
3. Implement tokenization and simple keyword-count clustering.
4. Implement cause inference and suggestion rules.
5. Wire UI: add note, delete note, analyze, export, import.
6. Add short README describing offline behavior and how grouping works.

Notes
- Keep logic simple and explainable; avoid ML/large models.
- Tune a small set of stopwords and a reasonable similarity threshold after testing with short notes.
- Prioritize practical, actionable suggestions over speculative features.
