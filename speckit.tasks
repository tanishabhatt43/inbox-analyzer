Speckit Tasks — Inbox Pattern Finder

1. Create `speckit.tasks` file documenting next work (DONE)
   - Purpose: Track actionable next steps and priorities.
   - Acceptance: File exists in repo with concise tasks.

2. Add 'Edit note' feature
   - Description: Allow users to edit existing notes (text, type, date).
   - Acceptance: Edit opens inline or modal and saves to `localStorage`.

3. Tune clustering (stopwords, threshold)
   - Description: Adjust stopword list and Jaccard threshold; test with varied short notes.
   - Acceptance: Documented threshold and rationale; grouping feels intuitive on sample data.

4. Add unit tests for tokenization & grouping
   - Description: Small test harness (node or browser) covering `tokensOf()` and `analyzeNotes()`.
   - Acceptance: Tests for several sample note sets pass.

5. Improve UX: mobile layout & accessibility
   - Description: Make layout responsive; add basic ARIA labels and keyboard navigation.
   - Acceptance: Layout usable on narrow screens; controls reachable by keyboard.

6. Add undo for deletions & confirmations
   - Description: Add brief undo snackbar after delete and confirmation for bulk import overwrite.
   - Acceptance: User can undo a delete within a short window.

7. Validate Export/Import and add sample dataset
   - Description: Ensure imported JSON is validated and provide a sample file for testing.
   - Acceptance: Import handles invalid files gracefully; sample JSON included.

8. Optional: Package as Electron app
   - Description: Bundle SPA into an Electron shell for native offline desktop use.
   - Acceptance: Simple Electron build that opens the app and persists `localStorage` per user.

Priority guidance
- First priorities: tasks 2,3,4 (small UX improvement, better grouping quality, test coverage).
- Medium: tasks 5,6,7.
- Optional/longer: task 8.

Notes
- Keep changes small and explainable. Each PR should include: problem statement, user action, offline behavior, short logic explanation, and a simple acceptance test.
